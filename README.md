# manipulator-inverse-kinematics-matlab
This is an implementation of inverse kinematics concepts using MATLAB to simulate a 4DOF RRRR Robotic arm
The concepts are taken from Intro to Robotics by John K. Craig
Thanks to Mr. Aron Becker for his efforts on providing a deep understanding into the kinematics concepts.
